I would like to share with you the data preprocessing project I developed as part of the Health Artificial Intelligence Competition at the previous Teknofest event. Within the scope of the project, I have developed specialized preprocessing codes for the processing and analysis of .dcm extension medical image data. I am excited to share these codes with you.

In my project, I have developed code snippets encompassing image preprocessing steps to enhance the processing and analysis of healthcare data. Through these codes, I achieved the conversion of .dcm extension files to .png format, resizing images for the ResNet algorithm, and reducing disparities between color channels. Additionally, I conducted image naming processes and file adjustments to maintain data integrity.
